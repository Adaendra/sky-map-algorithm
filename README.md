# Sky Map Algorithm
Algorithm implementation to locate stars in the sky.

--------
## Objectives
The goal is to implement an algorithm to locate stars in the sky for a date-time and a location. *(ex : lat: 35.689487, long: 139.691711, 01-01-2020 00:00)*

There is a lot of projects who use these algorithms but no-one have a simple librairy to reuse it.

A website will be added to use this algorithm and see results.
