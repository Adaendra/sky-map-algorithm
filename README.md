# Sky Map Algorithm
Algorithm implementation to locate stars in the sky for a date-time and a location.

--------
## Objectives
The goal is to implement an algorithm to locate stars in the sky for a date-time and a location. *(ex : lat: 35.689487, long: 139.691711, 01-01-2020 00:00)*

A website will be added to use this algorithm and see results.

With this algorithm, a lot of methods which use an astronomical formula are available in.

--------
## How to use it
In this project you will find some folders named with a langage name which contains algorithms and formulas inside.

Just pick the langage you need and copy-paste it in your project.

Current languages available :
* JavaScript
* TypeScript
