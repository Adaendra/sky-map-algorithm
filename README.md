# Sky Map Algorithm
Algorithm to locate stars in the sky

--------
## Objectives
The goal is to implement an algorithm to locate stars in the sky for a date-time and a location. 

*(ex : lat: 35.689487, long: 139.691711, 01-01-2020 00:00)*

A website will be added to use this algorithm and see results.
